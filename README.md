Hello there! Iâ€™m @iperib0, or Ignasi outside of Github.

I'm from Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain), so you can reach me in spanish -or even catalan- if you fancy!

Iâ€™m currently studying Multiplatform Application Development, a high technician degree ('Ciclo Formativo de Grado Superior' in the spanish educational system) about software development. We've learned the basics of: 
- Java
- SQL
- C# (along with .NET Framework and ASP.NET Core with Razor pages)
- Kotlin (for Android, mostly)
- PHP (along with Laravel framework)
- HTML & CSS
- And others like API usage, database management, ERM/CRM basics...

.
